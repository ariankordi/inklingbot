# Usage

  * Configure settings-sample.json, rename to settings.json
  * Make sure you have PHP 7 and that it works
  * Set your directory to this, or `cd` to it if you're in a shell
  * Run `python3 woomy.py` with every module it wants
  * The command prefix is `woomy `, turning on normie will give a little more of a hint on how to use it
  * `woomy mii` won't work because I haven't included what it wants in this repo, which is copyrighted
  * Sorry

# Warning
If you actually run this on your actual machine that you actually care about,

  * SystemExit will exit the script (if you are the owner)
  * compiler will expose your Python version
  * uname will expose the output of `uname -a`
  * os will expose your OS version
  * lsblk **will expose your hard disks by running `lsblk`** (via shell)
